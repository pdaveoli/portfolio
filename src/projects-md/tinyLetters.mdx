**Content note:** This project explores themes of mental health struggles and emotional distress.

# Overview
Tiny letters is a metaphorical adventure of a boy (known as -O) who tries to escape his mental health challenges through reaching out to people with letters. You play as a robotic postman that delivers these letters to those closest to the boy, each describing different challenges in his life.

The game aims to raise awareness about mental health and the importance of reaching out for help, while also highlighting how difficult that first step can be. Through its unique narrative structure and delivery mechanic, players experience both sides of the communication struggle - the one reaching out and those receiving the messages.

## Why This Project?
This game was made for the 2025 GameDev.TV Game Jam, with the theme "Tiny World". I wanted to create a game that not only fit the theme but also conveyed a meaningful message about mental health, a topic I am passionate about. The concept of a "tiny world" resonated with the idea that some people may feel small or insignificant when facing mental health challenges, and the game aims to shed light on these experiences with an emotional story.

The project achieved 28th in Story for the jam, out of 1,009 entries, which I am very proud of given the competition.
## Features
- Narrative-driven gameplay focusing on mental health themes.
- Dialogue system for delivering letters and interacting with NPCs.
- Extra letters found around the map that provide deeper insights
- Small simple map that degrades as you play on, representing mental health decline.
- Atmospheric music and sound effects to enhance immersion.
- Simple controls and mechanics to focus on the story and message.

## Tech Stack
The game was developed using Unity, C#, and published on Itch.io.
Assets were sourced from the Unity Asset Store and made using Blender.

## Challenges
### Narrative Design
I wanted to make the story feel real, without being too on-the-nose or preachy. However, I realised that the story just had to be real then, so I focused on writing authentic dialogue and scenarios that reflected real mental health struggles. I also had to balance the narrative with gameplay, ensuring that players remained engaged while still conveying the intended message. Many of the letters came from real experiences, making the game feel more personal and impactful.
### Game Mechanics
Designing the letter delivery mechanic was a challenge, as I wanted it to be simple yet meaningful.
### Time Management
The game jam's deadline was a week. I already started late, so I had to manage my time effectively to ensure I could complete the game on time. This involved prioritizing features, focusing on core mechanics, and avoiding scope creep.
### Music and Sound Design
Finding the right music and sound effects to match the game's tone and atmosphere was challenging. I wanted the audio to enhance the emotional impact without overpowering the narrative. I experimented with different tracks and soundscapes until I found a combination that worked well. I ended up using a mix of music online and my own compositions.

## What I Learnt
- Improved my skills in Unity and C# for game development.
- Gained experience in narrative design and storytelling within a game context.
- Learned to balance gameplay mechanics with narrative elements.
- Enhanced my time management skills for working within tight deadlines.
- Developed a better understanding of audio design and its role in creating atmosphere.
## Future Improvements
I would love to use this game idea as a base to create a larger game with more mechanics, levels, and a deeper story. However, in terms of this project, I feel like I could improve the following:
- Polish the dialogue and narrative to make it even more impactful.
- Make the game mechanics more balanced, feedback showed some jumps / areas were too difficult.
- Make it more clear where you need to go next, some players got lost.
- Add more sound effects to enhance immersion.
- Make the music more personalised to the game, rather than using stock music.
- Add more variety to the NPCs and their responses to the letters.

## Conclusion
Overall, this project has been such a rewarding experience. It has been a while since I made a game, and I really enjoyed the process of creating something meaningful within a short timeframe. The positive feedback from players has been incredibly motivating, and I hope that Tiny Letters can contribute to the ongoing conversation about mental health in a small but meaningful way.
