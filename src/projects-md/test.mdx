This is a test project to demonstrate the capabilities of MDX files in our project documentation system.
It includes metadata such as title, date, description, tags, and a pinned status.
Feel free to explore and modify this file as needed!
Here is a sample code block:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, MDX!");
```
You can also include other MDX features such as images, links, and more.
