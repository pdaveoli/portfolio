# Overview
When I thought about creating a personal portfolio website, I wanted to build something that not only showcased my projects and skills but also reflected my personality and design aesthetics. This website serves as a central hub for potential employers, collaborators, and anyone interested in learning more about my work.

I wanted it to also be reflective of me as a person, so I focused on creating elements that felt authentic to me, for example the music section on the homepage. The site is built as a content-driven system using MDX, reusable components, and dynamic routing, allowing me to add or update projects without touching core layout code.

]} />

## Why This Project?
I wanted a single, maintainable place to present my work professionally, so that when I apply for jobs or apprenticeships, I can easily share a link to my work. Additionally, building the portfolio website itself was a great opportunity to practice and showcase my web development skills using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Features
- Projects pages using MDX for easy content management.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.
- Clean and modern UI/UX using Tailwind CSS.
- Music section on the homepage to showcase my recent and top tracks.
- Contact button for easy communication.
- SEO optimization for better visibility in search engines.
- Light and dark mode support.
- Links to my Github and Itch.io profiles.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js for server-side rendering and routing.
- React.js for building interactive UI components.
- Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.
- MDX for content management of project pages.
- Vercel for deployment and hosting.
- Last.fm API for fetching music data.

## Challenges
### Responsive Design
Ensuring that the website looked great and functioned well across different devices and screen sizes was a challenge. I kept testing it both on my laptop and on my phone, making adjustments to the layout and styles as needed to ensure a seamless experience.
### Project Page Management
I already knew that I wanted an easy way to manage my project pages, so I decided to use MDX. However, I had never worked with it before, so I had to learn how to set it up and integrate it into my Next.js project. This involved researching MDX documentation and experimenting with different configurations until I found a setup that worked well for my needs.
### SEO Optimisation
I wanted to make sure my portfolio was easily discoverable by search engines, so I had to learn about SEO best practices and implement them on my site. This included optimizing meta tags, using semantic HTML, and ensuring fast load times.
### Music Integration
Integrating the Last.fm API to fetch and display my music data on the homepage was a new experience for me. I had to learn how to work with APIs, handle asynchronous data fetching, and display the data in a visually appealing way.

## What I Learnt
- Balancing personal expression with professional presentation.
- SEO optimisation and using metadata in Next.js.
- Using MDX for content management in a Next.js project.
- Integrating third-party APIs (Last.fm) into a web application.
- Enhancing UI/UX design skills with Tailwind CSS.
## Future Improvements
- Reworking the Hero section to make it more engaging
- Adding any additional projects I complete in the future
- Adding animations and interactive elements to enhance user experience
- Improving accessibility features to make the site more inclusive

## Conclusion
This portfolio website is a reflection of my skills, personality, and passion for web development. It serves as a platform to showcase my projects and connect with others in the industry. I am proud of what I have created and look forward to continuing to improve and expand it in the future.

This site will continue to evolve alongside my skills and projects.
